    <p>University life in Pakistan can be a strange paradox for cybersecurity students. At Air University, the system is designed to reward memorization, punctuality, and exam scores. Grades are king, and the ‚Äúratta‚Äù system ‚Äî where rote learning dominates ‚Äî leaves little room for experimentation. For a field like cybersecurity, which thrives on curiosity, hands-on practice, and creative problem-solving, this is a huge challenge.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">I found myself constantly at a crossroads. On one hand, there were exams, assignments, and back-to-back lectures demanding my attention. On the other, there were virtual machines to configure, Kali tools to explore, packet captures to analyze, and mini pentesting experiments waiting to be run. Choosing between marks and practical learning often meant sacrifices ‚Äî lower grades, occasional backlogs, and sleepless nights. But I made my choice: I prioritized skill and experience over immediate academic recognition.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Late nights became my classroom. I built networks from scratch, misconfigured firewalls to see what would happen, traced traffic to understand anomalies, and wrote scripts to automate small tasks. Every mistake became a lesson, every frustration an insight. The chaos was intense ‚Äî timetable clashes, fatigue, and the constant mental juggling of coursework and projects ‚Äî yet I embraced it.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">Over time, I realized something crucial: cybersecurity cannot be taught through memorization alone. Understanding systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and defending networks requires a mindset cultivated by exploration, curiosity, and real-world experimentation. Grades matter in a transcript, but skills matter in the field. And though the path was challenging, messy, and sometimes lonely, I started seeing the payoff: a foundation of knowledge and hands-on experience that no exam could ever provide.</p>
