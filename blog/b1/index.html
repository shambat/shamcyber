      Diving into the Wild Web: Shodan, Open Ports, and Lessons Learned
    </h1>

    <p>The first time I explored the internet through Shodan, it didn’t feel like an ordinary search engine experience. It was more like opening a small window into the hidden side of the web — where servers, devices, and forgotten systems quietly waited, still exposed to the public network.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">It started with curiosity. I had heard about how Shodan indexes internet-connected devices and how researchers use it to understand the real attack surface of the web. One night, with nothing but my Kali Linux VM and a notebook, I decided to see what it was all about.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">At first, nothing made sense. Most of my searches returned unreachable systems or devices that had long gone offline. It was like wandering through empty digital streets. But with time, I began to understand how to filter and focus. By adjusting my search queries — looking at specific open ports, filtering by regions, or narrowing down by service banners — the picture became clearer.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">What I found wasn’t about hacking or exploitation; it was about awareness. I started to notice common mistakes — default configurations, outdated software versions, and systems left publicly exposed without protection. It was both fascinating and eye-opening to realize how small misconfigurations could create large security risks.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">I began documenting what I saw — open directories, visible configuration files, public logs — not to exploit, but to understand how these oversights happen in real-world environments. That process taught me more about vulnerability assessment than any classroom lecture could. Each search, each IP, and each finding added a new piece to my understanding of network security.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">By the end of that night, I hadn’t “hacked” anything. What I did gain was something far more valuable — perspective. I learned how exposure happens, how attackers think when they scan for weaknesses, and how awareness and prevention play a huge role in cybersecurity. It was a quiet but powerful lesson that real-world exploration, done responsibly, can teach you far more than theory alone.</p>
